<h1>Hello and welcome to My Github repository</h1>
    <h4>
        To create the React Application, you need to create the folder then drag
        it into Visual Studio Code. Then cd into the folder and RUN "npx create-react-app ."
    </h4>
    <p>
        This Project is my final PLP Project.
        I created this project using React.js, MySQL, Node.js and Express.
    </p>
    <h4>I have included the images to show you how the frontend looks like.</h4>
    <h5>
        The image that follows shows the home page when you run the react application.

    <h2>HOW THIS APPLICATION WORKS</h2>
    <div>
        1. First I connected the Database with the React application.
        <br>
        2. I used MySQL Database as shown below.

        <p>
            3. When You run the react application, You will see the red button that says add contact. When You click in it
            you will enter details into the text area such as "ID", "name", "email" and "contact".
        <br>
            4. The next step is to submit the data. This data is then added to the Frontend Website. to add this to the database,
            you need to execute the data in the MySQL workbench and it will be added to the database or use any other software to execute.
            <br>
            5. You can also delete the data in the database. This is simply done by clicking
            on the delete button, you will be prompted to confirm whether you really wnt to delete the information or not, in the frontend,
            You can still execute the code in the MySQL workbench to delete the data.
            <br>
            6. You can also edit the data in the database by clicking on the edit button. You will see the update page shown bellow.
